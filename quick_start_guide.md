## Immediate Action Items

### 1. Register for Competition
```bash
# Go to Kaggle and accept competition rules
https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/arc-prize-2025
```

### 2. Download Training Data
```bash
kaggle competitions download -c arc-prize-2025
unzip arc-prize-2025.zip -d /mnt/d/opt/ARCPrize2025/data/
```

### 3. Explore the Data
```python
import json

# Load training data
with open('data/arc-agi_training_challenges.json', 'r') as f:
    train_challenges = json.load(f)

# Look at first task
first_task = list(train_challenges.values())[0]
print(f"Train examples: {len(first_task['train'])}")
print(f"Test examples: {len(first_task['test'])}")

# Visualize a task
def visualize_grid(grid):
    """Simple visualization of ARC grids"""
    colors = ['â¬›', 'ðŸŸ¦', 'ðŸŸ¥', 'ðŸŸ©', 'ðŸŸ¨', 'â¬œ', 'ðŸŸª', 'ðŸŸ«', 'ðŸŸ§', 'â¬œ']
    for row in grid:
        print(''.join(colors[cell] for cell in row))
```

### 4. Basic Solver Template
```python
# arc_solver.py
import json
import numpy as np

class SimpleARCSolver:
    def solve(self, task):
        """Basic solver that tries common patterns"""
        
        # Strategy 1: Check if output is always the same
        outputs = [ex['output'] for ex in task['train']]
        if all(np.array_equal(outputs[0], out) for out in outputs):
            return outputs[0]
        
        # Strategy 2: Check for simple transformations
        # Add more strategies here
        
        # Default: return input unchanged
        return task['test'][0]['input']

# Create submission
def create_submission(challenges, solver):
    submission = {}
    
    for task_id, task in challenges.items():
        predictions = []
        
        for test_input in task['test']:
            # Two attempts required
            solution = solver.solve(task)
            predictions.append({
                'attempt_1': solution,
                'attempt_2': solution  # Same for now
            })
        
        submission[task_id] = predictions
    
    return submission
```

### 5. Test Locally
```python
# Validate your submission format
def validate_submission(submission, challenges):
    for task_id in challenges:
        assert task_id in submission
        assert len(submission[task_id]) == len(challenges[task_id]['test'])
        
        for pred in submission[task_id]:
            assert 'attempt_1' in pred
            assert 'attempt_2' in pred
    
    print("âœ… Submission format is valid!")
```

## Your Advantages

### 1. **Pattern Recognition Experience**
Your HVAC diagnostic work is perfect training:
- Identifying patterns in sensor data â†’ ARC grid patterns
- Diagnosing faults from symptoms â†’ Inferring transformation rules
- Combining multiple signals â†’ Compositional reasoning

### 2. **Hardware Advantage**
```python
# Use your Hailo-8 for parallel hypothesis testing
def parallel_hypothesis_test(hypotheses, task, hailo_device):
    """Test 1000s of possible solutions in parallel"""
    batch_size = 100
    results = []
    
    for i in range(0, len(hypotheses), batch_size):
        batch = hypotheses[i:i+batch_size]
        # Run on Hailo-8
        batch_results = hailo_device.run_batch(batch, task)
        results.extend(batch_results)
    
    return results
```

### 3. **8-Model Architecture**
Apply your multi-model approach:
```python
class MultiModelARCSolver:
    def __init__(self):
        self.models = {
            'spatial': SpatialReasoner(),      # Like ZEPHYRUS
            'logical': LogicalReasoner(),      # Like AQUILO
            'pattern': PatternMatcher(),       # Like BOREAS
            'transform': Transformer(),        # Like VULCAN
            'validator': Validator(),          # Like GAIA
            'master': MasterSolver()          # Like APOLLO
        }
```
