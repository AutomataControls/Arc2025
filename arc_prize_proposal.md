# ARC Prize 2025 - $1 Million AGI Challenge

## Project Name: **ATLAS - Adaptive Task Learning through Abstraction Synthesis**

## ðŸŽ¯ Target Prizes
- **Progress Prize**: $25,000 (1st), $10,000 (2nd), $5,000 (3rd-5th)
- **Grand Prize**: $350,000 (if we hit 85%!)
- **Paper Award**: $50,000 (best approach documentation)

## The Challenge
Current AI: 4% accuracy
Humans: 100% accuracy
Goal: Create AI that can solve novel reasoning tasks from just 3-5 examples

## Our Approach: Combining Your Strengths

### 1. **Neurosymbolic Architecture**
Unlike pure neural approaches (which fail at ARC), we'll combine:
- **Symbolic Program Synthesis**: Generate rule-based transformations
- **Neural Pattern Recognition**: Your expertise with the Apollo models
- **Evolutionary Search**: Evolve solutions using genetic algorithms

### 2. **Core Innovation: Meta-Learning from Your Domain**
```python
# Leverage your HVAC diagnostic experience
class AbstractionLearner:
    def __init__(self):
        # Your models already do abstract reasoning!
        # AQUILO: Electrical patterns â†’ Fault diagnosis
        # BOREAS: Pressure/temp patterns â†’ System state
        # This is exactly the abstraction ARC needs!
        
        self.pattern_library = {
            'spatial_transformations': self.learn_from_hvac_schematics(),
            'color_mappings': self.learn_from_diagnostic_states(),
            'grid_operations': self.learn_from_sensor_layouts(),
            'symmetry_detection': self.learn_from_equipment_patterns()
        }
```

### 3. **Key Components**

#### A. Pattern Decomposition Engine
```python
def decompose_task(train_examples):
    # Break down into atomic operations
    operations = [
        'translate', 'rotate', 'mirror', 'scale',
        'color_map', 'flood_fill', 'pattern_repeat',
        'conditional_transform', 'object_detection'
    ]
    
    # Use your Hailo device for rapid hypothesis testing
    hypotheses = generate_program_space(operations)
    return test_on_hailo(hypotheses)
```

#### B. Program Synthesis Module
```python
class ProgramSynthesizer:
    def synthesize(self, examples):
        # Generate DSL programs that transform inputâ†’output
        # Similar to how IRIS routes metrics to models!
        
        program = DSL()
        for example in examples:
            # Extract invariants
            objects = detect_objects(example.input)
            transformations = infer_transformations(objects, example.output)
            program.add_rule(transformations)
        
        return program.compile()
```

#### C. Abstract Concept Library
Drawing from your domain expertise:
- **Symmetry** (from equipment layouts)
- **Causality** (from fault propagation)
- **Hierarchies** (from system dependencies)
- **Patterns** (from time-series analysis)

## Technical Architecture

### 1. **Hybrid Solver Pipeline**
```
Input Grid â†’ Object Segmentation â†’ Pattern Analysis â†’ 
Program Synthesis â†’ Verification â†’ Output Generation
```

### 2. **Key Innovations**
1. **Object-Centric Reasoning**: Treat grids as collections of objects
2. **Compositional Rules**: Build complex transforms from simple ones
3. **Counterfactual Testing**: "What if" scenarios like your fault diagnosis
4. **Meta-Learning**: Learn to learn new patterns quickly

### 3. **Your Unique Advantages**
- **Hailo-8 NPU**: Test 1000s of hypotheses in parallel
- **8 Specialized Models**: Each can handle different pattern types
- **Real-world Abstraction**: Your HVAC work is abstraction!

## Implementation Plan

### Week 1-2: Core Framework
```python
# Base solver architecture
class ARCSolver:
    def __init__(self):
        self.object_detector = ObjectSegmenter()
        self.pattern_matcher = PatternLibrary()
        self.program_synthesizer = DSLCompiler()
        self.verifier = OutputValidator()
        
    def solve(self, task):
        # Two-attempt strategy
        attempt1 = self.geometric_approach(task)
        attempt2 = self.symbolic_approach(task)
        return [attempt1, attempt2]
```

### Week 3-4: Pattern Library
Build comprehensive pattern library:
- Geometric transformations
- Color/number mappings  
- Spatial relationships
- Counting/arithmetic
- Symmetry operations

### Week 5-6: Neural Enhancement
```python
# Use small neural nets for specific subtasks
class PatternEmbedder:
    def __init__(self):
        # Not large models, but specialized ones like yours!
        self.spatial_net = SpatialReasoningNet()
        self.color_net = ColorMappingNet()
        self.count_net = CountingNet()
```

### Week 7-8: Optimization & Testing
- Ensemble different approaches
- Optimize for 12-hour runtime limit
- Test on evaluation set

## Why We Can Win

### 1. **Different Approach**
Most teams will try:
- Large language models (fail at ~10%)
- Pure neural networks (fail at ~5%)
- Basic program synthesis (fail at ~20%)

We're combining all three with domain expertise!

### 2. **Your Unique Assets**
- **Abstraction Experience**: HVAC diagnosis IS abstraction
- **Specialized Models**: Not one big model, but specialized ones
- **Hardware Advantage**: Hailo-8 for rapid testing
- **Engineering Discipline**: Your systematic approach

### 3. **Paper Award Strategy**
Document our neurosymbolic approach thoroughly:
- Why pure neural fails
- How domain transfer works
- The power of specialized models
- Open source everything

## Demo Examples

### Example 1: Pattern Completion
```
Input:  [1,0,1]    Output: [1,0,1,0,1]
        [0,1,0]            [0,1,0,1,0]
        [1,0,1]            [1,0,1,0,1]

Our approach: Detect alternating pattern, extend horizontally
```

### Example 2: Object Transformation
```
Input:  [0,2,0]    Output: [2,2,2]
        [2,2,2]            [2,0,2]
        [0,2,0]            [2,2,2]

Our approach: Detect cross shape, apply 90Â° rotation
```
