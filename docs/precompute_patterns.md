# Pattern Pre-computation Documentation

## Overview
The `precompute_patterns.py` script is the core component that runs on your DELPHI device with Hailo-8 NPU to analyze all ARC training tasks and build a comprehensive pattern library before submission to Kaggle.

## Purpose
This script leverages your unique hardware advantage (26 TOPS of compute power) to perform extensive pattern analysis that would be impossible within Kaggle's 12-hour runtime limit. By pre-computing patterns offline, we can:

1. **Analyze millions of pattern hypotheses** without time constraints
2. **Build a comprehensive pattern library** from all training tasks
3. **Cache transformation rules** for fast lookup during evaluation
4. **Extract feature vectors** for similarity matching

## Key Components

### 1. HailoPatternAnalyzer
The main class that coordinates pattern analysis across 8 specialized detectors (mirroring your Apollo Nexus architecture):

- **Geometric**: Rotations, reflections, translations, scaling
- **Color**: Color mappings, filtering, replacement rules
- **Counting**: Object counting, size-based patterns
- **Logical**: Conditional rules, boolean operations
- **Spatial**: Relative positions, alignments
- **Symmetry**: Symmetry creation and completion
- **Object**: Object manipulation and relationships
- **Composite**: Multi-step and hierarchical patterns

### 2. Pattern Detection Pipeline

```
Load Task → Extract Examples → Parallel Analysis on Hailo → 
Extract Transformations → Generate Features → Update Library
```

### 3. Transformation Analysis
For each task, the system extracts:
- **Size changes**: How dimensions transform
- **Color mappings**: Consistent color transformations
- **Position mappings**: Object movement patterns
- **Pattern rules**: High-level transformation logic

### 4. Feature Extraction
Creates numerical feature vectors for each task including:
- Grid dimensions (input/output)
- Color palette sizes
- Density metrics
- Shape features
- Symmetry scores

## Output

The script generates `precomputed_patterns.pkl` containing:
- **Pattern Library**: All discovered patterns with confidence scores
- **Task Analyses**: Detailed analysis of each training task
- **Transformation Cache**: Pre-computed transformation rules

## Usage

### Prerequisites
1. ARC training data downloaded to `data/arc-agi_training_challenges.json`
2. Hailo-8 device properly configured
3. Python environment with required packages

### Running the Script
```bash
cd /mnt/d/opt/ARCPrize2025
python precompute_patterns.py
```

### Expected Runtime
- With 400+ training tasks
- 8 parallel detectors per task
- Extensive hypothesis testing
- **Estimated time**: 2-4 hours on Hailo-8

### Output Files
- `precomputed_patterns.pkl` (10-50MB)
- Pattern analysis logs
- Performance metrics

## Integration with Submission

During Kaggle evaluation, your submission will:
1. Load the pre-computed pattern library
2. Extract features from test tasks
3. Find similar patterns using cached analyses
4. Apply learned transformations
5. Generate solutions in milliseconds (not minutes!)

## Advantages

1. **Unlimited computation time** vs 12-hour Kaggle limit
2. **Parallel processing** on 26 TOPS hardware
3. **Comprehensive analysis** impossible on standard hardware
4. **Fast inference** during actual evaluation

This pre-computation strategy is key to achieving the 85% accuracy needed for the $700K grand prize!
