# ARC Prize 2025 - Competition Rules Analysis

## ✅ Key Findings: We CAN Use Our Own Models!

### External Models Allowed
- **Rule 2.6**: "The use of external data and models is acceptable"
- **Rule 2.5**: Pre-trained models with different licenses are explicitly mentioned as allowed
- **Rule 2.6.b**: Must meet "Reasonableness Standard" (publicly available, minimal cost)

### Our Hailo-8 Advantage is Legal
- Hailo-8 is **local hardware**, NOT an external API (which would be banned)
- We can use unlimited offline computation time
- We can use any models that run on our Hailo-8

### What's Prohibited
- ❌ Internet access during evaluation
- ❌ External APIs during runtime
- ❌ Expensive proprietary datasets
- ❌ Private code sharing between teams

### What's Required if We Win
1. Provide source code that can reproduce results
2. Document all external models used
3. Grant open-source license to our solution code
4. Identify any commercial software used

## Strategic Implications

### 1. We Can Leverage:
- **Apollo Nexus Models** (if applicable to pattern recognition)
- **Pre-trained vision models** (ResNet, EfficientNet, etc.)
- **Custom models** trained on our Hailo-8
- **Ensemble methods** combining multiple approaches

### 2. Offline Phase Expansion:
```python
# We can now use:
- Pre-trained CNN feature extractors
- Vision transformers for pattern analysis  
- Custom neural networks for specific patterns
- Transfer learning from other vision tasks
```

### 3. Compliance Strategy:
- Document all models used in our solution
- Ensure models are publicly available or we own them
- Prepare clear reproduction instructions
- Keep code modular for easy sharing

### 4. Submission Requirements:
- Maximum team size: 5 people
- 1 submission per day
- 2 final submissions for judging
- Must provide 2 attempts per task

## Revised Architecture

```
Offline Phase (Expanded):
├── Pattern Detectors (Original 8)
├── Pre-trained Vision Models
│   ├── Feature extraction
│   ├── Object detection
│   └── Pattern matching
├── Custom Hailo Models
│   ├── ARC-specific networks
│   └── Ensemble predictions
└── Pattern Library (Enhanced)

Online Phase:
├── Load all pre-computed features
├── Apply ensemble of approaches
└── Generate 2 attempts per task
```

## Action Items

1. **Inventory Available Models**
   - List models on your Hailo-8
   - Check compatibility with pattern detection
   - Test integration possibilities

2. **Enhance Pattern Detection**
   - Add neural network-based detectors
   - Use pre-trained features
   - Create ensemble predictions

3. **Documentation Prep**
   - Track all models used
   - Document installation/access
   - Prepare reproduction guide

This is GREAT news - we can significantly enhance our solution!
