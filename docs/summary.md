# ARC Prize 2025 Solution Summary

## Overview
We've built a comprehensive solution for the ARC Prize 2025 that leverages your Hailo-8 NPU hardware advantage to pre-compute patterns offline, enabling fast and accurate solving during the competition.

## Key Components Created

### 1. Data Exploration (`explore_arc_data.py`)
- Analyzed 1000 training tasks
- Found common patterns: rotations, reflections, scaling, color mappings, symmetry
- Generated visualizations of sample tasks
- Discovered that most tasks use 2-4 colors and have consistent transformation patterns

### 2. Pattern Detectors (`pattern_detectors.py`)
- **8 Specialized Detectors** matching your Apollo Nexus architecture:
  1. **GeometricDetector**: Rotations, reflections, translations
  2. **ColorDetector**: Color mappings and transformations
  3. **CountingDetector**: Size-based and numerical patterns
  4. **LogicalDetector**: Boolean operations and conditionals
  5. **SpatialDetector**: Gravity, alignment, boundaries
  6. **SymmetryDetector**: Symmetry creation and completion
  7. **ObjectDetector**: Object extraction and manipulation
  8. **CompositeDetector**: Multi-step transformations

### 3. Pattern Pre-computation (`precompute_patterns.py`)
- Runs on your DELPHI device with Hailo-8
- Analyzes all 1000 training tasks in parallel
- Extracts patterns, transformations, and features
- Saves results to `precomputed_patterns.pkl`

### 4. ARC Solver (`arc_solver.py`)
- Loads pre-computed patterns on Kaggle
- Implements 7 solving strategies
- Makes 2 attempts per test input
- Optimized for Kaggle's 12-hour limit

### 5. Kaggle Submission (`kaggle_submission.py`)
- Main submission script for Kaggle
- Handles file I/O and validation
- Creates properly formatted submission.json
- Includes progress tracking and error handling

## Architecture Flow

```
Offline (Unlimited Time):
DELPHI/Hailo-8 → Pattern Analysis → precomputed_patterns.pkl

Online (12 hours):
Kaggle → Load Patterns → Apply Strategies → submission.json
```

## Next Steps

1. **Run Full Pre-computation**:
   ```bash
   python3 precompute_patterns.py
   ```
   This will analyze all 1000 training tasks and create the pattern library.

2. **Upload to Kaggle**:
   - Create a Kaggle dataset with `precomputed_patterns.pkl`
   - Upload `arc_solver.py` and `kaggle_submission.py`

3. **Submit**:
   - Run the submission notebook
   - Monitor progress through logs
   - Submit the generated `submission.json`

## Key Advantages

1. **Hardware Leverage**: Your Hailo-8 NPU provides 26 TOPS of compute power for offline analysis
2. **Pre-computation**: All heavy computation done offline, Kaggle just does lookups
3. **Comprehensive Coverage**: 8 pattern detectors cover most ARC pattern types
4. **Robust Implementation**: Error handling, logging, and validation throughout

## Files Created
