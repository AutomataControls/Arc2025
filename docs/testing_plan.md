# ARC Prize 2025 - Testing Plan

## Competition Clarifications

Based on the competition rules:
- **You get MULTIPLE submissions** (not just one!)
- Each submission provides **2 attempts per task** (attempt_1 and attempt_2)
- Submissions are evaluated on Kaggle with compute/time limits
- Leaderboard shows semi-private scores, final evaluation on private set
- Need **85% accuracy** to win the grand prize ($700K)

## Testing Strategy

### Phase 1: Local Development Testing

1. **Quick Pattern Test** (Already done âœ“)
   ```bash
   python3 test_precompute.py
   ```
   - Verified pattern detectors work
   - Found patterns in sample tasks

2. **Mini Pre-computation Test**
   ```bash
   # Create mini version with first 50 tasks
   python3 precompute_patterns.py --limit 50
   ```
   - Test the full pipeline
   - Verify pattern library creation
   - Check file sizes and timing

3. **Local Accuracy Testing**
   ```bash
   python3 test_framework.py
   ```
   - Test on evaluation data (or training subset)
   - Measure current accuracy
   - Identify weak patterns
   - Generate failure analysis

### Phase 2: Pattern Improvement

Based on test results:

1. **Analyze Failures**
   - Which patterns fail most?
   - What transformations are we missing?
   - Are there edge cases?

2. **Improve Detectors**
   - Add missing pattern types
   - Refine existing detectors
   - Improve confidence scoring

3. **Add More Strategies**
   - Implement fallback strategies
   - Add hybrid approaches
   - Handle edge cases better

### Phase 3: Full Pre-computation

1. **Run Full Analysis**
   ```bash
   python3 precompute_patterns.py
   ```
   - Analyze all 1000 training tasks
   - Expected time: 2-4 hours on Hailo-8
   - Output: precomputed_patterns.pkl (~50MB)

2. **Validate Pattern Library**
   - Check file integrity
   - Verify pattern counts
   - Test loading speed

### Phase 4: Kaggle Testing

1. **Create Test Submission**
   - Upload small pattern library
   - Submit on subset of data
   - Check Kaggle runtime and memory

2. **Monitor Performance**
   - Time per task
   - Total runtime
   - Memory usage
   - Error handling

3. **Iterate Based on Results**
   - Fix any Kaggle-specific issues
   - Optimize for speed if needed
   - Improve accuracy based on leaderboard

### Phase 5: Final Submissions

1. **Submission Strategy**
   - Start with conservative approach
   - Gradually improve based on feedback
   - Save best submission for end

2. **Track Progress**
   - Document each submission
   - Note accuracy improvements
   - Learn from leaderboard

## Testing Commands Summary

```bash
# 1. Test pattern detectors
python3 pattern_detectors.py

# 2. Test on small dataset
python3 test_precompute.py

# 3. Run accuracy testing
python3 test_framework.py

# 4. Run full pre-computation (when ready)
python3 precompute_patterns.py

# 5. Check results
cat failure_analysis.json
```

## Success Metrics

- [ ] Pattern detectors identify >80% of patterns
- [ ] Local accuracy >70% (before optimization)
- [ ] Full pre-computation completes <4 hours
- [ ] Kaggle submission runs <2 hours
- [ ] Accuracy reaches 85% threshold

## Next Immediate Steps

1. Run `test_framework.py` to measure current accuracy
2. Analyze which patterns need improvement
3. Run mini pre-computation to test full pipeline
4. Make first test submission to Kaggle

Remember: You have multiple submissions, so we can iterate and improve!
