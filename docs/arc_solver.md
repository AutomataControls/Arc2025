# ARC Solver Documentation

## Overview
The `arc_solver.py` file contains the main solver implementation that runs on Kaggle during the evaluation phase. It loads pre-computed patterns from your Hailo-8 analysis and applies them to solve test tasks within the 12-hour runtime limit.

## Purpose
This solver is designed to:
1. **Load pre-computed pattern library** generated by your Hailo-8
2. **Analyze test tasks** to find similar patterns
3. **Apply learned transformations** to generate solutions
4. **Make two attempts** per test input as required by competition rules

## Key Components

### 1. ARCSolver Class
The main orchestrator that:
- Loads the pre-computed pattern library
- Coordinates multiple solving strategies
- Manages the two-attempt requirement
- Handles submission formatting

### 2. Solving Strategies

The solver implements 7 complementary strategies:

1. **PatternMatchStrategy**: Uses pre-computed pattern library to find exact matches
2. **GeometricStrategy**: Detects rotations, reflections, and translations
3. **ColorMapStrategy**: Identifies consistent color transformations
4. **ObjectBasedStrategy**: Analyzes object manipulation patterns
5. **SymmetryStrategy**: Detects and applies symmetry operations
6. **SizeBasedStrategy**: Handles grid size transformations
7. **CompositeStrategy**: Combines multiple transformation types

### 3. Two-Attempt System

For each test input, the solver makes two attempts:
- **Attempt 1**: Uses the best matching pattern or primary strategy
- **Attempt 2**: Tries an alternative strategy or variation

This maximizes the chance of finding the correct solution.

## Workflow

### 1. Initialization
```python
solver = ARCSolver('precomputed_patterns.pkl')
```
Loads the pattern library generated offline by your Hailo-8.

### 2. Task Analysis
```
Extract Features → Find Similar Patterns → Select Strategy
```

### 3. Solution Generation
```
Apply Strategy → Validate Output → Format Submission
```

## Pattern Matching Process

1. **Feature Extraction**: Converts task to numerical features
   - Grid dimensions
   - Color palette size
   - Density metrics
   - Shape characteristics

2. **Similarity Search**: Finds similar tasks in pattern library
   - Cosine similarity on feature vectors
   - Returns top 10 matches

3. **Transformation Application**: Applies learned rules
   - Size changes
   - Color mappings
   - Geometric transformations
   - Complex patterns

## Performance Optimization

The solver is optimized for Kaggle's constraints:
- Pre-computed patterns eliminate heavy computation
- Fast numpy operations for transformations
- Early termination when solution found
- Efficient memory usage

## Integration with Pre-computation

The solver expects `precomputed_patterns.pkl` containing:
```python
{
    'patterns': {...},           # Pattern library
    'task_analyses': {...},      # Detailed task analyses
    'transformation_cache': {...} # Cached transformations
}
```

## Usage in Competition

During evaluation:
1. Kaggle loads test challenges
2. Solver loads pre-computed patterns
3. For each task:
   - Analyzes similarity to training tasks
   - Applies best matching strategies
   - Generates two attempts
4. Creates submission.json

## Error Handling

The solver includes robust error handling:
- Missing pattern library: Falls back to basic strategies
- Invalid inputs: Returns safe defaults
- Size constraints: Ensures outputs are within 30x30 limit

## Extensibility

New strategies can be added by:
1. Creating a class inheriting from `SolverStrategy`
2. Implementing the `solve()` method
3. Adding to the strategies dictionary

This modular design allows easy experimentation and improvement!
